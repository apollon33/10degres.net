There is a lot of resources available about hacking and security, here are my favorites.

Some blogs I frequently visit from bounty hunters themself. 
They explain their findings, why it occurs, how they were able to exploit and sometimes how much they win. 
I visit them once a week and I also follow their writer on Twitter to not miss the bugs they don't review.   

In my opinion the best way to learn hacking and security is to read public disclosure. 
It's a great resources of tips and tools to use to make your life easier.
Some of my favorites issues, the ones I like to read again and again to understand the vulnerability and try to discern the state of mind of the hacker who found it. 
It's also a good way to improve your report skill and see the way hackers communicates with security teams to keep good feelings. 

Each Time I learn a new kind of issue, I try to reproduce it on on my local lab, then I try it on security programs I'm currently working on.
Sometime it works, sometimes not but bug bounty is also about patience. Happy reading !
