<p><a href="https://exploit-exercises.com/nebula/" title="Exploit Exercises, Nebula" class="flashlink" target="_blank">Nebula</a> is part of Exploit Exercises, 
it covers a variety of simple and intermediate challenges that cover Linux privilege escalation, common scripting language issues, and file system race conditions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This level requires you to find a Set User ID program that will run as the “flag00” account. 
You could also find this by carefully looking in top level directories in / for suspicious looking directories.
Alternatively, look at the find man page.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this first level, you have to find a file owned by <code class="highlighter-rouge">flag00</code> with suid bit. 
A single command can do the trick:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>find / -user flag00 -perm /6000
</code></pre>
</div>

<!--more-->

<p>Alternatively you can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">-uid 999</code> where <code class="highlighter-rouge">999</code> is the user id of <code class="highlighter-rouge">flag00</code> which can be found in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/etc/passwd</code>. 
This outputs the same result:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>find / -user 999 -perm -u+s
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">/bin/.../flag00</code> is the key. 
When you run it you become another user due to the suid. 
Here is the POC:</p>

<p>The redirection is only used to avoid the errors triggered by the system when you try to read a forbidden directory.</p>
