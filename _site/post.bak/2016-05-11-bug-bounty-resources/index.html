<p>In my opinion the best way to learn hacking and security is to read public disclosure. 
It’s a great resources of tips and tools to use to make your life easier.</p>

<p>Here are some blogs I frequently visit from bounty hunters themself. 
They explain their findings, why it occurs, how they were able to exploit and sometimes how much they win. 
I visit them once a week and I also follow their writer on Twitter to not miss the bugs they don’t review.</p>

<p>To stay aware of new bugs who run in wild I follow some other blogs about web security. 
Those are professional blogs, they always try to sell you something but whatever, the goal here is to learn.
Most of the time they also explain how to protect agains the attacks, wich is a very good point to add in a bug report.</p>

<p>Finally here are some of my favorites issues, my current top 15, the ones I like to read again and again to understand the vulnerability 
and try to discern the state of mind of the hacker who found it. 
It’s also a good way to improve your report skill and see the way hackers communicates with security teams to keep good feelings.</p>

<p>Each Time I learn a new kind of issue, I try to reproduce it on on my local lab, then I try it on security programs I’m currently working on.
Sometime it works, sometimes not but bug bounty is also about patience.</p>

<p>Happy reading !</p>
