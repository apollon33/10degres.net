After many years of web development, I finally decided to change my way. Security has always been a dream so the goal is now to perform as a pentester.

Luckily, nowadays there is tons of documentation, pdf, videos, blog, course about offensive security on Internet. Reading, learning, training became my daily.
The goal of this site is not to teach anything to anyone but it's a very good reminder for me. Plus it's good way to test more deeply the tools used by professional pentesters and hackers.

In october 2015, after 3 months of hard work, I successfully passed the famous Offensive Security Certified Professional exam aka OSCP. 
Now as a real training, I work on bug bounty programs on [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/glc){:class="flashlink" target="_blank"}.
